surveyfinalquestions
what did you think of the robot?
The robot should have more interesting colors. The robot's map should be more clear so it can be understood. Additionally, stay there enough to see the map. I like it.
What do you want to change about the robot so that you would like it more?
I would change the colors and add a female robot.
